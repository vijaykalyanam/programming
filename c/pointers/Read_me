Pointers:

Variable: It is a name give to one or more group of memory address(s).
Pointer : It is variable, which always holds memory address(s).

int i;	i is a variable which holds data, specifically integers only.

int *p;	==> Interpret as: int* p; ===> 'p' is variable which holds data
	which must be memory address of integer data.
	So, p is pointer to integer.

int **pp; ===>  int** pp; pp is pointer to pointer to integer.
		To read value, we need to dereferrence two times.

int a[5];  'a' is array of 5 integers and 'a' is pointing to the first element(First Integer).
         
 	    Memory allocated for 5 integers sequentially and given Name to the
	    memory address for first element.
So, 'a' is a constant pointer. 'a' always points to the same memory address.

Here, a  == int *p;
      &a == int **pp; This is not correct.
      &a == int (*ptr)[3];

To hold some variable address, It is nothing but pointer to it.


Array of funtion pointers:

int (*functionpointer[3]) (int, char );


int i;
int *p;
int **pp;

int (*pa)[3];                                            
int *pa[3]; ==> int* ap[3]; array of pointers.                                            

        p = arr;
        pa = &arr;
        pp = ap;

Above will not give any errors.


Now,

Array of 1D array pointers:

pointer to 1D array:	int (*pa)[4];   *pa is enclosed within ()
					so priority goes to it first.

interpretation is -> pa is pointer and the type of pointer is pointing to array of 4 integers.

So,

(*arap[4])   --> So, arap is array of 4 pointers. And the type of pointer is yet to figure out.

To make it, pointers to 1D array,

int (*arap[4])[4];


pointer to constant data: Regular way.

const int a = 10;

int *p;
const int *pc;==> const int* pc;
	pc is pointer to const integer.

pc = &a;  this is correct.
p = &a;   This is not correct.



Declaration for pointer to 2D array:

int (*q)[m][n] = NULL; m,n can be formal arguments or auto variables.

--> *q - give pointer to 1D array.
--> *q + 1 -> will Leads SEQ FAULT.

void allocate (int (**q), int m, int n)
{
	int (*p)[m][n];

	p = malloc();

	or

		if q == NULL,
			*q = (int (*)[m][n]) malloc();
}

constant pointer:

pointer always point to the same memory location as assigned for the first time.

example: int arr[3], char str[] = "VIJAY"; char *str = "BUDIGI";


int const *ptr or const int *ptr ==> pointer to constant data.

int *const ptr ==> constant pointer.


what is the diff b/n char str[] = "VIJAY" and char *str = "BUDIGI";


char str[] = "VIJAY";

1. size will be calculated by compiler.
2. str is constant pointer.

char *s = "BUDIGI";

1. String data saved in readonly section and Data is Constant.
2. s is not constant pointer, but the data 's' is pointing to is constant.

s[3] = 'z';  Bang ... Bang ... SEGFAULT.
